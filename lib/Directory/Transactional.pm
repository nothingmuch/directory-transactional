=head1 NAME

Directory::Transactional - ACID transactions on a set of files with
journalling/recovery using C<flock> or L<File::NFSLock>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Directory::Transactional;

	my $d = Directory::Transactional->new( root => $path );

	$d->txn_begin;

	$d->txn_commit;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides lock based transactions over a set of files with full
supported for nested transactions.

=head1 THE RULES

There are a few limitations to what this module can do.

Following this guideline will prevent unpleasant encounters:

=over 4

=item Always use relative paths

No attempt is made to sanify paths reaching outside of the root.

All paths are assumed to be relative and within the root.

=item No funny stuff

Stick with plain files, with a link count of 1, or you will not get what you
expect.

For instance a rename will first copy the source file to the txn work dir, and
then when comitting rename that file to the target dir and unlink the original.

While seemingly more work, this is the only way to ensure that modifications to
the file both before and after the rename are consistent.

Modifications to directories are likewise not supported, but support may be
added in the future.

=item Always work in a transaction

If you don't need transaction, use a global lock file and don't use this
module.

If you do, then make sure even your read access goes through this object with
an active transaction, or you may risk reading uncomitted data, or conflicting
with the transaction commit code.

=item Use C<global_lock> or make sure you lock right

If you stick to modifying the files through the API then you shouldn't have
issues with locking, but try not to reuse paths and always reask for them to
ensure that the right "real" path is returned even if the transaction stack has
changed, or anything else.

=back

=head1 ACID GUARANTEES

ACID stands for atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability.

Transactions are atomic (using locks), consistent (a recovery mode is able to
restore the state of the directory if a process crashed while comitting a
transaction), isolated (each transaction works in its own temporary directory,
and durable (once C<txn_commit> returns a software crash will not call the
transaction to rollback).

=head1 TRANSACTIONAL PROTOCOL

This section describes the way the ACID guarantees are met:

When the object is being constructed a nonblocking attempt to get an exclusive
lock on the global shared lock file using L<File::NFSLock> or C<flock> is made.

If this lock is successful this means that this object is the only active
instance, and no other instance can access the directory for now.

The work directory's state is inspected, any partially comitted transactions
are rolled back, and all work files are cleaned up, producing a consistent
state.

At this point the exclusive lock is dropped, and a shared lock on the same file
is taken, which will be retained for the lifetime of the object.

Each transaction (root or nested) gets its own work directory, which is an
overlay of its parent.

All write operations are performed in the work directory, while read operations
walk up the tree.

Aborting a transaction consists of simply removing its work directory.

Comitting a nested transaction involves overwriting its parent's work directory
with all the changes in the child transaction's work directory.

Comitting a root transaction to the root directory involves moving aside every
file from the root to a backup directory, then applying the changes in the work
directory to the root, renaming the backup directory to a work directory, and
then cleaning up the work directory and the renamed backup directory.

If at any point in the root transaction commit work is interrupted, the backup
directory acts like a journal entry. Recovery will rollback this transaction by
restoring all the renamed backup files. Moving the backup directory into the
work directory signifies that the transaction has comitted successfully, and
recovery will clean these files up normally.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 4

=item root

This is the managed directory in which transactional semantics will be maintained.

This can be either a string path or a L<Path::Class::Dir>.

=item _work

This attribute is named with a leading underscore to prevent thoughtless
modification (if you have two workers accessing the same directory
simultaneously but the work dir is different they will conflict and not even
know it).

The default work directory is placed under root, and is named C<.txn_work_dir>.

The work dir's parent must be writable, because a lock file needs to be created
next to it (the workdir name with C<.lock> appended).

=item nfs

If true (defaults to false), L<File::NFSLock> will be used for all locks
instead of C<flock>.

Note that on my machine the stress test reliably B<FAILS> with
L<File::NFSLock>, due to a race condition (exclusive write lock granted to two
writers simultaneously), even on a local filesystem. If you specify the C<nfs>
flag make sure your C<link> system call is truly atomic.

=item global_lock

If true instead of using fine grained locking, a global write lock is obtained
on the first call to C<txn_begin> and will be kept for as long as there is a
running transaction.

This is useful for avoiding deadlocks (there is no deadlock detection code in
the fine grained locking).

This flag is automatically set if C<nfs> is set.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Transaction Management

=over 4

=item txn_do $code, %callbacks

Executes C<$code> within a transaction in an C<eval> block.

If any error is thrown the transaction will be rolled back. Otherwise the
transaction is comitted.

C<%callbacks> can contain entries for C<commit> and C<rollback>, which are
called when the appropriate action is taken.

=item txn_begin

Begin a new transaction. Can be called even if there is already a running
transaction (nested transactions are supported).

=item txn_commit

Commit the current transaction. If it is a nested transaction, it will commit
to the parent transaction's work directory.

=item txn_rollback

Discard the current transaction, throwing away all changes since the last call
to C<txn_begin>.

=item lock_path_write $path, $no_parent

Lock the resource at C<$path> for writing or reading.

By default the ancestors of C<$path> will be locked for reading to (from
outermost to innermost).

The only way to unlock a resource is by comitting the root transaction, or
aborting the transaction in which the resource was locked.

C<$path> does not have to be a real file in the C<root> directory, it is
possible to use symbolic names in order to avoid deadlocks.

Note that these methods are no-ops if C<global_lock> is set.
