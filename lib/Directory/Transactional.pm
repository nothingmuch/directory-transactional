=head1 NAME

Directory::Transactional - ACID transactions on a set of files with
journalling/recovery using C<flock> or L<File::NFSLock>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Directory::Transactional;

	my $d = Directory::Transactional->new( root => $path );

	$d->txn_begin;

	$d->txn_commit;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides lock based transactions over a set of files with full
supported for nested transactions.

=head1 ACID GUARANTEES

Transactions are atomic (using locks), consistent (a recovery mode is able to
restore the state of the directory if a process crashed while comitting a
transaction), isolated (each transaction works in its own temporary directory,
and durable (once C<txn_commit> returns a software crash will not call the
transaction to rollback).

=head1 TRANSACTIONAL SEMANTICS

When the object is being constructed a nonblocking attempt to get an exclusive
lock on the global shared lock file using L<File::NFSLock> or C<flock> is made.

If this lock is successful this means that this object is the only active
instance, and no other instance can access the directory for now.

The work directory's state is inspected, any partially comitted transactions
are rolled back, and all work files are cleaned up, producing a consistent
state.

At this point the exclusive lock is dropped, and a shared lock on the same file
is taken, which will be retained for the lifetime of the object.

Each transaction (root or nested) gets its own work directory, which is an
overlay of its parent.

All write operations are performed in the work directory, while read operations
walk up the tree.

Aborting a transaction consists of simply removing its work directory.

Comitting a nested transaction involves overwriting its parent's work directory
with all the changes in the child transaction's work directory.

Comitting a root transaction to the root directory involves moving aside every
file from the root to a backup directory, then applying the changes in the work
directory to the root, renaming the backup directory to a work directory, and
then cleaning up the work directory and the renamed backup directory.

If at any point in the root transaction commit work is interrupted, the backup
directory acts like a journal entry. Recovery will rollback this transaction by
restoring all the renamed backup files. Moving the backup directory into the
work directory signifies that the transaction has comitted successfully, and
recovery will clean these files up normally.
